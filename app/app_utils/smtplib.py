    Sends an email with the classification results as an attachment.

    The function fetches the JSON file containing the classification results from MinIO,
    creates an email message with the JSON file as an attachment, and sends the email
    using the specified SMTP server (MailHog).

    Args:
        email (str): The recipient's email address.
        json_minio_path (str): The path to the JSON file in MinIO.
        ticket_number (str): The ticket number associated with the classification request.
        minio_client (Minio): The MinIO client instance.
        minio_bucket (str): The name of the MinIO bucket where the JSON file is stored.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        Exception: If an error occurs while sending the email.

    Note:
        The function uses MailHog as the SMTP server for sending emails. Make sure MailHog
        is running and accessible at the specified SMTP server and port.

        The function creates a temporary file to store the fetched JSON file locally before
        attaching it to the email. The temporary file is automatically deleted when the
        function exits.
