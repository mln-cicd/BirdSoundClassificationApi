### Download model weights
You need to manually download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gMoLpgnpGw2c15mVVyN6W6e4FDHCD24n?usp=sharing) the model weights and the pre-trained model contained in the .zip called `models.zip` and put the content in a folder called `model` at the root of the project.

### Download example image to launch the inference notebook
Donwload the .zip called `data.zip` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gMoLpgnpGw2c15mVVyN6W6e4FDHCD24n?usp=sharing) and put its content in a folder called `data` at the root of the project.
